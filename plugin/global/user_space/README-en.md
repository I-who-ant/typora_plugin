# User Space Readme

Welcome to your personal user space!

This is a dedicated directory reserved for you. You can store any of your personal files here, such as:

* Custom configurations
* Personal scripts or plugins
* Project files or assets
* Notes and memos

## Key Feature: Data Persistence

**When the plugin is updated, all files and subdirectories within this directory will be automatically preserved. They will NOT be overwritten or deleted during the update process.**

You can think of this directory as your personal "documents folder" within the plugin, ensuring your data remains safe across upgrades.

## Development Support

If you plan to develop on typora_plugin, you can place the required files here and obtain the target file through `__plugin_utils__.getUserSpaceFile(fileName)`.
